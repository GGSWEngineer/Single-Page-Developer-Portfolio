## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- using the min, max, clamp functions to build more responsive websites!
- for this project flex for 1 dimension and grid for 2 dimension layouts worked great.
- pixel perfect can be used as a tool to help you build pixel perfect websites! (google chrome extension) although still need not comfortable with it yet
- using utility classes to clean up css


### Continued development

- positioning background elements like the circles, and rings in this project
- how to grow the images from one size to another (375px - 768px) and (768px - 1440px)
